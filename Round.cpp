Function Name: Round (constructor)
Purpose: To set up the beginning of each round
Parameters:
            Player *human - a reference variable to the human player
            Player *computer - a reference variable to the computer player
            Deck deck - an instance of the deck class
            int inNextPlayer - an integer that contains the player who will take the next turn
            int inRoundNumber - an integer that contains the current round number
            vector<Melds> melds - a vector that contains all available melds in the game
Return Value:
            none
Local Variables:
            none
Algorithm:
            1) sets the human, computer, nextPlayer, and round number to correct values
            2) retrieves the deck, shuffles the deck, and deals the cards.
            3) sets the meld suit to the trump card suit for the melds that have the trump card suit as a requirement
            4) sets both player's round scores to 0.
