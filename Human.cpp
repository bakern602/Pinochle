Function Name: playCard
Purpose: to allow the player to choose a card to play
Parameters:
            int lead - determines whether player is lead or not
            Card leadCard - the turn's leadCard
            Card trumpCard - the round's trump card
Return Value:
            the value of the card to be played by the player
Local Variables:
            int card - the card at which to play from the given pile
            int pile - the pile at which to play the card from
Algorithm:
            1) prompt user to enter a value for the pile they'd like to play from (check input)
            2) prompt user to enter a value of the card they'd like to play from that pile (check input)
            3) store chosen card in a temporary card
            4) erase the chosen card from the hand/meld pile
            5) return the chosen card

Function Name: makeMelds
Purpose: to allow the human to make a meld with current cards
Parameters:
            vector<Melds> possibleMelds - a vector containing game's available melds
Return Value:
            none
Local Variables:
            int num - the number of cards the player wants to add to meld
            int card[num] - the indexes at which the cards are located in the hand
Algorithm:
            1) prompt user to enter the amount of cards to add to meld
            2) prompt user to enter all cards they wish to add (validate input)
            3) add the chosen cards to the player's meld pile
            4) validate the new meld is legal
            5) if legal erase those cards from hand
            6) if not legal, take them out of the meld pile

Function Name: checkMelds
Purpose: to validate the melds a player tries to make
Parameters:
            vector<Melds> possibleMelds - a container for the game's available melds
Return Value:
            boolean value that indicates whteher a meld is legal or not
Local Variables:
            bool isGood - a boolean value storing the legaity of the meld
            int t_meldPoints - an integer containing the current meld's point total
Algorithm:
            1) check current meld against all available melds
            2) add the meld value for each meld to t_meldPoints (adds 0 if the meld does not exist)
            3) if t_meldPoints is greater tha meldPoints (meaning a new meld was created that turn...
            4) set isGood to true
            5) add to the round score of the player
            6) update meldPoints to be t_meldPoints (the new amount of points earned from melds
